In this repository, we present our solution for the FemHack Data Science challenge, which involved utilizing AI to analyze petitions on Change.org and predict their likelihood of success.

We have uploaded two projects developed using Google Colab. The first project focuses on data exploration, where we studied the behavior of the data and drew conclusions regarding the significance of various columns. In the second project, we addressed the challenge of language diversity by translating the "titles" variable to ensure all information was in a single language. Additionally, we tested multiple models to achieve optimal performance.

After evaluating different models, we selected Random Forest due to its accuracy of 92%.
